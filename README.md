📘 Overview This project focuses on analyzing storm boundaries by applying the Convex Hull algorithm to geospatial storm data. The Convex Hull serves as a minimal boundary that encompasses all storm data points, aiding in visualizing and understanding the extent of storm-affected areas.

🧠 Objectives Implement the Convex Hull algorithm to determine storm boundaries.

Visualize storm data and their corresponding convex hulls for better interpretation.

Provide an interactive Jupyter Notebook for users to explore and understand the analysis.
